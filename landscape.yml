                KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge.It is built upon
                kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for network, application deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and
                edge.

                Our goal is to make an open platform to enable Edge computing, extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at
                Edge
              summary_business_use_case: >
                KubeEdge has found widespread adoption across multiple industries, including transportation, energy, internet, CDN, manufacturing, and smart
                campuses. Some of the notable use cases include:

                Tiansuan Constellation Program: KubeEdge has been integrated into the cloud-native satellite computing platform initiated by the Shenzhen
                Institute of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with Spacety Co., Ltd. KubeEdge brings in orbit-earth collaboration for
                the Tiansuan-1 Satellite in the platform, this integration has enabled new service scenarios such as image inference, incremental deep learning,
                and federated learning.

                China's highway electronic toll collection (ETC) system: KubeEdge has been instrumental in managing nearly 100,000 edge nodes and over 500,000
                edge applications in 29 of China's 34 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. With these applications, the system processes more than
                300 million data records daily and supports continuous updates of ETC services on highways. As a result, the time taken to pass through toll
                stations has been reduced from 29s to 3s for trucks, and from 15s to 2s for cars.

                Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge: KubeEdge manages edge nodes deployed on the world's longest sea crossing bridge, which collects up to 14
                different types of sensor data, including light intensity, carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure, noise, temperature, humidity, PM 2.5, PM 10,
                rain and snow, acceleration, angular velocity, Euler angle, magnetic field, and sound. It also enables business apps and device mapper and AI
                interference programs to be deployed at the edge.

                SAIC MAXUS MIFA 9: The next-generation car-cloud collaborative architecture, SAIC MAXUS full-size luxury, smart, pure electric MPV MIFA 9, has
                become the first-ever vehicle with KubeEdge Inside. This platform can manage 100,000+ nodes and millions of edge devices and is based on
                KubeEdge's capabilities such as lightweight architecture, optimized for unstable cloud-edge networks at scale, simplified heterogeneous IoT
                device management, and edge autonomy in the case of disconnection.

                CDN platform of China Telecom: KubeEdge is used to manage CDN edge nodes, automatically deploy and upgrade CDN edge services, and implement edge
                service disaster recovery (DR) when migrating CDN services to the cloud.

                China Mobile On-line Marketing Service Center: The largest call center in the world, with 44,000 agents, 900 million users, and 53 customer
                service centers, builds a cloud-edge synergy architecture consisting of two centers and multiple edges based on KubeEdge.

                Xinghai IoT: This IoT company provides comprehensive smart building solutions by leveraging a construction IoT platform, intelligent hardware,
                and AI. Xinghai IoT built a smart campus with cloud-edge-device synergy based on KubeEdge and its own Xinghai IoT cloud platform, greatly
                improving the efficiency of campus management. With AI assistance, nearly 30% of the repetitive work is automated.

                SF Express: The largest integrated logistics service provider in China and the fourth largest in the world, completely transformed their supply
                chains by implementing KubeEdge. The smart supply chain system enables edge-cloud synergy, edge data collection, real-time edge data processing,
                massive IoT device management, and creates a more stable, secure, and reliable edge industrial IoT system.

                The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) Project defines a framework and set of standards for identifying and securing
                communications between application services. At its core, SPIFFE is:


                A standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are called SPIFFE IDs and are implemented as Uniform Resource
                Identifiers (URIs).


                A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or SVIDs.


                An API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the Workload API.


                The SPIFFE Project has a reference implementation, the SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment), that in addition to the above, it:


                - Performs node and workload attestation.


                - Implements a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.


                - Provides an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated SPIFFE IDs.


                - Provides and manages the rotation of keys and certs for mutual authentication and encryption between workloads.


                - Simplifies access from identified services to secret stores, databases, services meshes and cloud provider services.


                - Interoperability and federation to SPIFFE compatible systems across heterogeneous environments and administrative trust boundaries


                The SPIFFE Workload API can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to
                establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. Use of SPIFFE can
                also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.
              summary_business_use_case: >
                In today's business environment, rapidly delivering innovative customer experiences through differentiated applications and services is
                necessary for competitive advantage. As a result, organizations witness a change in how applications and services are being architected, built,
                and deployed. New technologies such as cloud and containers help organizations release faster, at scale. Services need to be built at high
                velocity and deployed on a vast plethora of platforms. As development accelerates, these systems are becoming increasingly interdependent and
                interconnected to deliver a consistent customer experience.


                Organizations may be inhibited in achieving high velocity and gaining market share or mission assurance for such major reasons as compliance,
                the pool of expertise, and interoperability challenges between teams/organizations and within existing solutions.


                For business leaders focused on improving business expediency and returns, SPIFFE can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of
                managing and issuing cryptographic identity documents (e.g. X.509 certificates), and accelerate development and deployment by removing the need
                for developers to understand the identity and authentication technologies required to secure service-to-service communication.


                Technology integration as a result of organizational convergence can be a challenge when different technology stacks must come together and
                interoperate. Aligning on a common, industry-accepted standard for system-to-system communication with identity and authentication, simplifies
                the technical aspects of full interoperability and integration across multiple stacks.


                SPIFFE brings a shared understanding of what constitutes software identity. By further leveraging SPIFFE Federation, components in disparate
                systems in different organizations or teams can establish trust to communicate securely without the added overhead of constructs such as VPN
                tunnels, one-o certificates, or shared credentials for use between such systems.

              summary_personas: Kubernetes users who need persistent storage in their cluster.

              summary_use_case: >-
                * Highly available persistent storage for Kubernetes

                In the past, ITOps and DevOps have found it hard to add replicated storage to Kubernetes clusters. As a result many non-cloud-hosted Kubernetes
                clusters don’t support persistent storage. External storage arrays are non-portable and can be extremely expensive.

                Longhorn delivers simplified, easy to deploy and upgrade, 100% open source, cloud-native persistent block storage without the cost overhead of
                open core or proprietary alternatives.

                * Easy incremental snapshots and backups

                Longhorn’s built-in incremental snapshot and backup features keep the volume data safe in or out of the Kubernetes cluster.

                Scheduled backups of persistent storage volumes in Kubernetes clusters is simplified with Longhorn’s intuitive, free management UI.

                * Cross-cluster disaster recovery

                External replication solutions will recover from a disk failure by re-replicating the entire data store. This can take days, during which time
                the cluster performs poorly and has a higher risk of failure.

                Using Longhorn, you can control the granularity to the maximum, easily create a disaster recovery volume in another Kubernetes cluster, and
                failover to it in the event of an emergency.

                If your main cluster fails, you can bring up the app in the DR cluster quickly with a defined RPO and RTO.

                 Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator, providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to integrate with cloud-native environments natively.
                 Ceph is a distributed storage system that provides block, file, and object storage and is deployed in large-scale production clusters.
                 Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. The Rook operator builds on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.
                 The storage cluster can be run hyper-converged beside your applications, in a cloud, or on bare metal. Rook provides a consistent storage platform anywhere Kubernetes runs.
              summary_business_use_case: |2-
                 Rook provides a consistent storage platform, whether in the cloud or on bare metal. The storage cluster is managed through Kubernetes Custom Resources, making integrating with your existing DevOps/ GitOps toolset easy.
                 For your applications to consume storage, they simply need to use the Kubernetes native approach of creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
                 Running a Rook Ceph cluster is made accessible due to the operator pattern.
                 The operator pattern allows the Rook project to handle most tasks automatically (e.g., updating to a new Ceph version). These automatic processes reduce the time spent setting up, configuring, maintaining, and updating your Rook storage cluster.

                WasmEdge provides a high-performance, lightweight, secure, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native applications. It is an OCI
                compliant container that is integrated into Docker, containerd, crun and many Kubernetes projects.  Compared with traditional Linux container
                apps, WasmEdge apps are more secure, more portable, cold-start 100x faster and only take 1/10 of the space.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                WasmEdge improves cloud app’s operational efficiency by providing a secure, portable, fast, and lightweight alternative to traditional Linux
                containers. It allows microservice or servelsss applications to “scale to zero” — all computing resources can be made available on-demand, and
                “write once run anywhere”. It also works with existing container management infra and programming languages, and hence minimizing the cost of
                adoption and migration. It is great for running microservices and serverless functions embedded in data pipelines or SaaS platforms.

                K8GB is a powerful tool for managing global Kubernetes deployments and provides features such as load balancing, failover, and intelligent
                routing. K8GB works by creating a set of custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the Kubernetes cluster, which define the global traffic routing
                policies. These policies are used by K8GB to configure the DNS servers to route traffic to the appropriate cluster or region.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                K8GB (Kubernetes Global Balancer) is an open-source project that provides a global traffic management solution for Kubernetes clusters. It is
                designed to simplify the configuration and management of DNS-based traffic routing for multi-cluster and multi-region Kubernetes deployments. It
                makes Kubernetes-based applications resistant to regional-wide failures.

                Emissary-Ingress is a k8s-native, Envoy-based API gateway. It is designed to allow teams to work in a more decentralized way than the
                traditional Ingress object. Emissary-Ingress can scan for its CRDs across all namespaces, so development teams can deploy new network routing
                rules along with the apps that use them, increasing velocity. Emissary-Ingress can be extended via API calls with authentication and rate
                limiting services. It is compatible with all the CNCF service meshes, and facilitates canary deployments when integrated with Argo Rollouts.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Emissary-Ingress speeds up deployment time and reduces the burden on platform teams by empowering developers to deploy new routes in a
                self-service manner. Platform/cloud teams can centrally manage hosts and certificates while developers can manage the resources relevant to
                them.

                Aeraki Mesh has been created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh, including Dubbo,
                Thrift, bRPC, Redis, etc., and private protocols as well.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many(if not all) service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP
                protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. This is an obstacle for a lot of organizations when they try to leverage service
                mesh's promised capablities to simplify their microservice development and operation. Aeraki Mesh solve this problem by providing a common
                layer-7 service mesh framework both in data plane and control plane, which is built on top of Envoy and Istio and can work with them together

                Telepresence speeds up development teams by allowing them to instantly test changes in dev or staging environments without having to wait for
                their changes to be built into a container and deployed. It also saves money by enabling developers to share cloud environments to do
                integration testing.

                Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating
                updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes' API extension system, and to
                integrate with Prometheus and other core components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Flux supports multi-tenancy and support for syncing an
                arbitrary number of Git repositories, among other long-requested features.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                GitOps is the natural evolution of configuration as code. Businesses moving to Flux can deal with infrastructure at scale more easily, and allow
                their developers to focus on code, not on deployment problems. With its vast ecosystem of Flux integrations and being integrated into cloud
                offerings everywhere, adopting Flux can be adopted in virtually every setup.

                Keptn supports teams that build their next generation platform on Kubernetes by solving the following 3 major challenges:
                1: Tame observability tool complexity: Keptn unifies access to ALL observability data through a single metrics server
                2: Remove complex delivery pipeline logic: Keptn provides deployment lifecycle tasks natively in Kubernetes
                3: Root cause for deploy change impact: Keptn emits end-2-end telemetry data to understand and troubleshoot deployments
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Engineering teams want to have flexibility and choose the best tool for their needs, creating complex pipelines that are hard to control and
                maintain. Using Keptn, teams can focus on the application code and forget about Deployment complexity and tool integration. Similarly, SREs can
                enforce their SLOs/SLAs at the application and microservice levels.

                The Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) provides APIs that simplify microservice architecture development and increases developer
                productivity. Whether your communication pattern is service-to-service invocation or pub/sub messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and
                secured microservices. By letting Dapr’s sidecar take care of the complex challenges such as service discovery, message broker integration,
                encryption, observability, and secret management, developers can focus on business logic and keep their code simple.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Deliver distributed system applications in half the time. Dapr provides APIs that abstract away the complexity of common challenges developers
                encounter regularly when building distributed applications. These API building blocks can be leveraged as the need arises - use one, several, or
                all to develop applications faster and deliver solutions on time. Dapr leverages proven practices for distributed application development that
                enable developers to build resilient, secured systems. By using Dapr in your application, you adopt these best practices without having to spend
                time solving common challenges.
